## NodeJS Telegram Bot with Speech to text, Text to Speech and Watson Assistant
This project aims to facilitate and democratize the development of Chat Bots for people who do not have any programming skills

## Motivation
This project was created from a request from a salesperson in the company where I work, he needed a ChatBot but he did not understand programming, so I decided to create this project where he just needs to put the credentials of the necessary services and develop the conversation on the Watson Assistant platform

2. Crete a Telegram bot and get his token

    2.1 Enter in the Telegram app and speak with @BotFather

    2.2 Use the /newbot command to create a new bot. The BotFather will ask you for a name and username, then generate an authorization token for your new bot.

    2.3 The name of your bot is displayed in contact details and elsewhere.

    2.4 The Username is a short name, to be used in mentions and telegram.me links. Usernames are 5-32 characters long and are case insensitive, but may only include Latin characters, numbers, and underscores. Your bot's username must end in â€˜botâ€™, e.g. â€˜tetris_botâ€™ or â€˜TetrisBotâ€™.

    2.5 The token is a string along the lines of 110201543:AAHdqTcvCH1vGWJxfSeofSAs0K5PALDsaw that is required to authorize the bot and send requests to the Bot API.

    2.6 Write down his token in the notepadðŸ“‘ as well.
